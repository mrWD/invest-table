 * native shell the Support section is not rendered, and every link to the author's sites
 * carries `?from=app`. Those sites hide their donation buttons for that visitor for twelve
 * hours: mrwd.github.io through its `from-app.js`, and this app's own web build through
 * `cameFromApp` below, under the same storage key. Everyone else on the web still sees
